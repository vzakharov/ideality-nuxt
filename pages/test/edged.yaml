            “In the market segments Edged.AI is targeting, we expect
            standalone-DLA [deap learning accelerator] chips will quickly give
            way to SoCs [systems on chip] that integrate a DLA. But developing
            the latter consumes more time and money, putting it beyond the reach
            of many startups, particularly new entrants coming late to the game.
            Edged wisely abandoned its early ambitions as a chip vendor, instead
            using IP to serve SoC vendors and others needing DLAs for internal
            chip designs.”

                  Edged Lite: Free tensor cores to make your chip smarter


                  As a chip manufacturer, you know that AI is one of the most
                  important trends in computing today. But developing your own
                  AI cores is a time-consuming, expensive and risky process.
                  With Open Edge by Edged, you can get access to ready-to-run,
                  optimized AI cores for free.

                  Why Edged?

                  Silicon-tested

                  Unlike many other AI IP companies, we’ve built and shipped
                  tensor cores in silicon. It means you won’t risk wasting time
                  and money on an IP core that won’t work in real applications.

                  [Read Cognitive Pilot case study]


                  Focused on speed & efficiency

                  Unlike GPUs, our cores are designed from the ground up for
                  tensor processing. They achieve latency and energy efficiency
                  that no GPU can match.

                  [See technical characteristics]


                  Rich software package & docs

                  Our IP cores come with a rich software package that includes a
                  compiler and all the tools you’ll need to integrate and run
                  your AI applications, as well as comprehensive user guides.

                # Open Edge: Free Tensor Cores for Everyone!


                Join the AI game with high-performance, silicon-proven AI cores.


                Second frame:


                As a chip manufacturer, you know that AI is one of the most
                important trends in computing today. But developing your own AI
                cores is a time-consuming, expensive and risky process. With
                Open Edge, you can get access to ready-to-run, optimized AI
                cores for free.

                Why Edged?


                ## Silicon-tested

                Unlike many other AI IP companies, we’ve built and shipped
                tensor cores in silicon. It means you won’t risk wasting time
                and money on an IP core that won’t work in real applications.


                ## Rich software package

                Our IP cores come with a rich software package that includes a
                compiler and all the libraries and tools you’ll need to
                integrate and run your AI applications.


                ## Focused on speed & efficiency

                Unlike GPUs, our cores are designed from the ground up for
                tensor processing. They achieve latency and energy efficiency
                that no GPU can match.

                      Subtitle: “The advent of AI-powered edge devices is
                      creating a new market for specialized hardware, which must
                      be not only powerful, but also super-fast,
                      energy-efficient, small-sized, and, well, cheap.”

                      %CUT FROM HERE%

                      The excitement around AI is at its peak right now, with
                      billions of dollars being poured into the development of
                      new technologies that promise to make our lives easier.
                      The more we rely on AI, the bigger the need for powerful
                      hardware becomes.


                      [Explain why GPUs don’t work]

                      But what kind of hardware? As it turns out, not all types
                      are created equal: GPUs might be great for training models
                      and running inference in data centers, but when we’re
                      talking about “smartifying” things like security cameras,
                      autonomous vehicles, and other edge devices that will be
                      deployed in the wild, their intrinsic limitations become
                      painfully obvious.

                        ## A round peg in a square hole


                        Although GPU manufacturers are increasingly focusing on
                        AI applications, the chips they ship still retain a lot
                        of legacy from the days when they were primarily used
                        for gaming. If you look closely inside the high-end GPUs
                        that are used in the most demanding ML tasks these days,
                        you will find things like shaders, rasterization units,
                        and so on. It’s understandable: for example, RTX 3090,
                        NVIDIA’s flagship GPU as of late 2021, is meant both for
                        high-performance gaming and for AI — and you can’t just
                        leave millions of gamers behind.

                      - - - >+
                            Obviously, any excessiveness leads to
                            inefficiencies. These might not be an issue for
                            cloud computing uses, where you can just throw in
                            more GPUs and get more computing power. But when you
                            have to squeeze every last drop of performance out
                            of your hardware, every ounce of waste counts.


                            The efficiencies that are especially critical for
                            edge uses are:


                            * **High power consumption**: A typical “edge-grade”
                            GPU consumes around [tba]W, which might not sound
                            like much, but in a typical IoT application with a
                            battery-powered device it’s not.


                            * **Low computational density**: A GPU that can
                            deliver [tba] TOPS — a performance expected of, say,
                            an AI-powered security camera — will occupy around
                            [tba] square inches of space.


                            * **High latency**. A super-performant GPU in a
                            self-driving car won’t be any useful if it takes it
                            a few hundred milliseconds to respond to an
                            emergency situation.


                            * **High price tag**: By buying a GPU for your edge
                            device, you’re essentially paying for decades of R&D
                            invested in gaming, and all the technologies that
                            you won’t be using.

                                ## The rise of the tensors


                                All this is where tensor processing units (TPUs)
                                come in. TPUs are dedicated hardware
                                specifically designed for AI applications.
                                Although at the moment there is no strict
                                technical definition of what a TPU is, they are
                                generally considered to be compute-optimized
                                ASICs that can run neural networks at high
                                speed.


                                The central element in a TPU is a systolic
                                array, a type of a spatial computing structure.
                                In a systolic array, data flows through the
                                network in a way that resembles the flow of
                                blood through our veins, hence the name. Thanks
                                to their architecture, systolic arrays can
                                perform tasks such as matrix computation or
                                convolution — which what the majority of neural
                                network computations are based on — in a single
                                run, without reading any data from memory.


                                (For a more detailed explanation of how TPUs
                                work, read this excellent post by the creators
                                of Google’s TPU.)

                                  TPUs trade universality for specialization.
                                  They are not as flexible and powerful as GPUs,
                                  but they can perform matrix operations at a
                                  speed that is simply unmatchable by any GPU or
                                  CPU on the market today. [Size and power
                                  density] As a result, they can fit the same
                                  power in a much smaller space, and they
                                  consume a fraction of the power. [Latency]
                                  Their circuitry is also much more
                                  straightforward, which translates into a much
                                  shorter signal path, and thus lower latency.
                                  [The cost] Finally, TPUs don’t carry the
                                  burden of legacy technologies, which means
                                  that they can be manufactured at a much lower
                                  cost.

                                          ## Any chip can be a TPU


                                          Speaking of IP cores, they present an
                                          excellent opportunity for non-AI chip
                                          manufacturers to get in on the TPU game.
                                          Provided their documentation is clear,
                                          comprehensive and well-maintained, and
                                          with the right set of software tools to
                                          implement specific neural network
                                          algorithms, they can be used to create
                                          AI chips for particular applications.


                                          Such “tensor cores” could be used to
                                          introduce AI features into a variety of
                                          already existing devices, ranging from
                                          security cameras to drones and from
                                          infotainment systems to self-driving
                                          cars. In doing so, the chip manufacturer
                                          doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel, but
                                          can simply leverage the existing IP core
                                          and software ecosystem.


                                          The price to license an IP core is
                                          typically around [tba] per chip, but it
                                          depends on the application and
                                          performance characteristics. Some IP
                                          cores are even available for free, such
                                          as NVIDIA’s [tba] or Edged’s Open Edge.
                                          This can be a viable option for
                                          relatively low-performance applications
                                          such as security cameras or [tba].

                                            A cautionary note here is that not all
                                            IP cores are in a production-ready
                                            state. Software packages such as [tba]
                                            allow pretty much anyone to code and run
                                            a simulated version of an IP core, but
                                            model or lab performance doesn’t always
                                            translate directly to real-world
                                            performance. This risk can be mitigated
                                            by using so-called “silicon-proven”
                                            cores, but in the end it’s still a
                                            gamble.

                                              ## The future of AI chips?


                                              As AI chips become more common in
                                              different kinds of devices, they will no
                                              longer be thought of as AI chips per se.
                                              They will simply be considered a new
                                              type of hardware that’s specialized for

                                              that, although GPUs will keep their
                                              ground in cloud-based AI applications,
                                              they will gradually lose their position
                                              in the IoT market

                                                expensive and slow for edge devices.


                                                AI chips will continue to evolve, with
                                                performance increasing at a steady pace,
                                                while power consumption is being reduced
                                                in parallel. Eventually they might even
                                                become invisible — just like CPUs are
                                                today. And

                                                  still much ground to be covered. Some of

A specific and as of yet almost-untapped area is training on the edge, which will allow us to build AI-powered devices that are field-ready from the start.

                                                        Finally, we feel like there’s a pressing
                                                        need for the industry to become more
                                                        open. As it stands, a lot of valuable
                                                        research is proprietary and closed. This
                                                        leads to fragmentation in the ecosystem,
                                                        hampers progress, and leads to a “rich

                      Outline

                      1. The AI industry is booming, but the hardware that
                      powers it is not.

                      2. The industry is effectively monopolized by a few big
                      players, who enjoy economies of scale and captive supply
                      chains.

                      3. This is a problem for many chipmakers, who can’t make
                      money off the hardware they themselves produce.

                      4. How can this situation be improved?

                      A. By addressing the entry barriers with respect to the
                      DLA market.

                      B. By adopting IP core solutions that enable easy
                      integration into silicon.

                      C. By lowering the cost of DLA solutions through
                      innovation rather than quality deterioration.

                      5. A look into the future: What will democratizing AI
                      hardware mean for the industry — and the world?

                             This is especially evident in the cloud computing market, where hyperscalers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft are spending billions [need to fact-check] to build their own proprietary hardware. Sometimes (cue Google TPU) they go as far as only making them available through their cloud infrastructure and not letting the customer actually touch them at all. The situation in edge computing is not much different, with the likes of Nvidia and Intel reaping the fruits of a captive market.

                              An oligopoly is bad for any industry, but it is
                              especially problematic in this case becauseit
                              throttles innovation. While machine learning
                              algorithms and paradigms advance at a breakneck
                              pace, incumbent hardware vendors have little
                              reason to evolve their chips to keep up with these
                              advancements. If you look closely inside even the
                              high-end chips available for training, you will
                              probably find that they are just repackaged GPUs
                              that have been around for over a decade, with
                              shaders, memory, caches and all sorts of other
                              bells and whistles inherited back from the days
                              when GPUs were meant to run video games. This
                              negligence is largely due to the fact that the
                              vendors are under no pressure to innovate.

                                  But there’s a silver lining here. The fact
                                  that these chips are not designed to power the
                                  next generation of AI applications also means
                                  that smaller players can come in and fill the
                                  void. By being nimbler, more flexible and more
                                  agile, they can innovate faster than the
                                  incumbents and offer products that are better
                                  tailored to real-world applications, at lower
                                  cost. Whether it’s new startups targeting
                                  specific branches of AI or existing chipmakers
                                  looking to make a splash in an industry that
                                  has been dominated by giants, there is a lot
                                  of room for disruption in the AI hardware

                                    When people think about AI-enabled devices,
                                    they usually think about self-driving cars.
                                    But there’s a lot more to it than that, from
                                    robotics to smart cities, from home security
                                    to farming. One of our customers, Cognitive
                                    Pilot, produces control units for combined
                                    harvesters. Although this application is far
                                    from the fancy world of Teslas and Waymos,
                                    it might be even more important because it
                                    shows how AI can be used to solve real-world
                                    problems.

                                      But farmers are not rockefellers: They
                                      count every penny, and they are not
                                      willing to invest in expensive
                                      technologies unless it brings them a
                                      return. When Cognitive Pilot started
                                      talking to one of the incumbent chip
                                      vendors, they had to negotiate like crazy
                                      and still got a chip the perfomance of
                                      which was mediocre at best. Needless to
                                      say, that didn’t work out too well.


                                      When they reconsidered and decided to use
                                      a chip from a much smaller company — along
                                      with an Edged IP core* — they got twice as

                                        ## To the core


                                        Speaking of IP cores, we think that the
                                        current situation in AI hardware is a
                                        prime example of how IP can be used to
                                        democratize an industry. The thing is,
                                        building any chip from scratch — let
                                        alone an AI one — is not easy. It
                                        requires a lot of knowledge and
                                        expertise, and it takes time — both of
                                        which are in short supply. Worst of all,
                                        it is a logistical nightmare unless
                                      - - - you already

                                                          And that’s where IP core vendors come
                                                          in. They can provide the missing
                                                          expertise, and they can do it at a
                                                          fraction of the cost that would be
                                                          needed to build an AI chip from scratch.
                                                          And since they don’t have a historical
                                                          connection to the world of GPUs and
                                                          video games, they can design their cores
                                                          to be more efficient and less

                                                          every watt counts.

                                               have a chip vendor.

                                              But if you can build an IP core, all of
                                              this is much easier. The only thing that
                                              matters is the performance per dollar,
                                              and there are plenty of AI-related tasks
                                              where it’s not hard
                                            - >2-
                                               have the right connections.

                                              But there is a way around all of this:
                                              you can buy an IP core from Edged and
                                              use it to build your own chip. This
                                              saves you time, money and headaches;
                                              plus, if you are not
                                        - >2-
                                           you have a ton of money to spend.

                                          But if you take an existing IP core and
                                          modify it to suit your needs, you can do
                                          that in a matter of days or weeks — not
                                          years. And by choosing the right IP
                                          cores from
                                        - >2-
                                           you are a massive company.

                                          So if you want to build an AI chip, the
                                          best way is probably to use existing IP
                                          cores and adapt them for your needs. And
                                          that’s exactly what Edged is doing: We
                                          have developed
                                        - >2-
                                           you have a lot of money to throw around.

                                          But the fact that anyone can use an IP
                                          core from Edged is what makes it so
                                          valuable. This means that startups with
                                          small budgets and limited resources can
                                          get into this business, which in

                                           you have a big enough team to deal with it.

                                          But IP cores are different: they can be
                                          used in any chip, whether it’s the one
                                          you build yourself or some other
                                          vendor’s. And since you don
                                        - >2-
                                           you happen to be a big company.

                                          Instead of building their own chips,
                                          many startups simply want to use the IP
                                          they already have in their possession
                                          and distribute it as widely as possible.
                                          This is exactly what Edged has done,
                                          making our

                                           you have a very large team, which is not the case for most startups.

                                          In contrast, IP cores can be used to
                                          build AI chips in a matter of weeks or
                                          months — and they are much easier to
                                          understand than full-blown So

                                  But there’s a silver lining here. The fact
                                  that these chips are not designed to power the
                                  next generation of AI applications also means
                                  that smaller players can come in and fill the
                                  void.

                                  By being nimbler, more flexible and more
                                  agile, they can innovate faster than the
                                  incumbents and offer products that are better
                                  tailored to real-world applications, at lower
                                  cost. Whether it’s new startups targeting
                                  specific branches of AI, or existing
                                  chipmakers looking to make a splash in an
                                  industry that has been dominated by giants,
                                  the race is on.

                                  As for the small players, they are effectively
                                  locked out of the market. The entry barriers
                                  for a new chip vendor are simply too high, and
                                  it is not uncommon to see startups that have
                                  developed their own chips fail because they
                                  can’t get them manufactured at scale — let
                                  alone get them into the hands of customers.

                                    While the GPU vendors are clearly the
                                    biggest beneficiaries of this situation, it
                                    is not clear that they are the only ones
                                    that are happy. It’s hard to argue that the
                                    lack of competition is good for customers
                                    since it translates to high prices, long
                                    product cycles and minimal innovation.

                                    This is a problem for many chipmakers, who
                                    can’t make money off the hardware they
                                    themselves produce. They are forced to
                                    either sell their chips at a loss or give up
                                    on selling them
