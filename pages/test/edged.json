A super-performant GPU in a self-driving car won’t be any useful if it takes it a few hundred milliseconds to respond to an emergency situation.\n\n* **High price tag**: By buying a GPU for your edge device, you’re essentially paying for decades of R&D invested in gaming, and all the technologies that you won’t be using.\n\n",

Although at the moment there is no strict technical definition of what a TPU is, they are generally considered to be compute-optimized ASICs that can run neural networks at high speed.\n\nThe central element in a TPU is a systolic array, a type of a spatial computing structure. In a systolic array, data flows through the network in a way that resembles the flow of blood through our veins, hence the name. Thanks to their architecture, systolic arrays can perform tasks such as matrix computation or convolution — which what the majority of neural network computations are based on — in a single run, without reading any data from memory.\n\n(For a more detailed explanation of how TPUs work, read this excellent post by the creators of Google’s TPU.)\n\n",

[Latency] Their circuitry is also much more straightforward, which translates into a much shorter signal path, and thus lower latency.

It’s not that they are making them up from pure imagination. But the very word “operation” in the definition is ambiguous.

And then you have to ask yourself, what are the chances that this particular architecture will be relevant to my application? If an IP core identifies hot dogs in images at 20 TOPS, it doesn’t automatically mean that it will achieve the same levels while processing video from security cameras.
